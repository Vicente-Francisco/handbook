# Culture



## Friday drinks
Civilized...

## Tealbuilding
Not always so civilized ;)

## Lunchbreaks
Most of us take, coming from an enterprise environment, pretty long lunchbreaks.

## External/internal
Doesn't matter, we are happy to have you on board!

## 100% transparancy
Salary  
The best example of this principle is our open salary policy. The salary package of every Teal Partner is shared and discussed with all the colleagues.
Compensation gets adjusted to fit an employeeâ€™s internal peer-driven valuation.


Dropbox  
We use the same level of transparancy and open communication with our clients. All project information, budgets, scope lists, assumptions and ideas are available at any time.

## Get fresh and stay clean
If you come by bike, you can take a shower at the office.
If it's hot outside, you're free to come in short throusers and flip-flops.
