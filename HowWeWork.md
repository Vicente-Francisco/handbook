##Self management
At Teal Partners we work heavily product driven. Note product, not project. We look further than just a IT project and help pushing the product to delivering maximal business value. The team manages the project: from gathering specs, creating software, deploying to production, all the aspects of the software lifecycle.

##Informal meetings
We make particularly good use of informal coffee breaks where we meet with colleagues without script, agenda or set of action items to discuss. 
Instead we would start with questions like "So, what's on your mind?", "Can you tell me about that", "Can you help me understand?", "What should we be worried about?".
These non-agenda meetings became a forum where current realities tended to bubble to the surface.

We are colleagues who debate vigorously in search of the best answers, yet who unify behind decisions, regardless of egocentric interests.
