# Getting Started

Congratulations! If you are reading this you probably are our latest latest addition!  
To make life easier, we have made an overview of what we expect from you and what you can expect from us.

## Before The First Day

In order for getting fast at speed, it is essential that all the materials are ready on the first day.
We all provide this for you but we need to know what we need to buy.
For the PC, you have a choice between a laptop or desktop.
Usually, as a laptop, something like an Dell XPS 15 is chosen. 
We also provide all peripherals such as mouse, keyboard and monitor.
If you need anything else for your PC, let us know!
If something is agreed on GSM, subscription or company car, we like to arrange this in advance. 
For the company car it is necessary to go to different garages and forward the offers to us.
The leasing company will then prepare a proposal for each quote.

In advance (or on the first day) we also give you access to all necessary accounts and services such as:
* Pluralsight
* Work email (Google)
* Visual Studio (MSDN)
* Slack
* Dropbox
* Toggl
* LastPass

## The First Day!

The exciting first day!
This day you need to quickly review this manual, fully install/update your laptop and familiarize yourself with your first project! 
Teal Partners is a company with a horizontal hierarchy, which means that you are already in the highest position: **Partner**.
This also means that there is self management and that you must/may decide how you want to work.
Because there is no boss, your colleagues will be happy to guide you.


## The Next Few Days And Weeks

The next days and weeks you will be better acquainted with your new colleagues and be fully involved with your first project.
