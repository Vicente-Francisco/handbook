# Teal Partners Employee Handbook

When we started in 2016 with 3, when a new person joined the company, they were expected to figure things out for themselves. 
But when we grew from in one year to more than 14, our “introduction by immersion” style was harder. 
We wanted to avoid that new hires felt lost and isolated, and looked around us to see how other companies did it. 
Inspired by [Basecamp Employee Handbook](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook) and [Valve Handbook For New Employees](http://media.steampowered.com/apps/valve/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdf), we decided to do something simular. Future will tell if it works out :)

It can be unnerving to join any company, but perhaps Teal partners in particular, given how different some of our practices are. 
If you come from a typical enterprise, there’s as much to unlearn as there is to learn. 
Prior to this handbook, navigating that path was both somewhat random and almost entirely oral. 
For a company that prides itself on self-managment and open communication, that just wasn’t right.

So, this is where we’ll try to share what’s worth knowing about Teal Partners the company, our culture, our process, and our history. 
This handbook also offers us an opportunity to clarify who we actually are as a company. 
What do we stand for? How should we work? 
Codifying those beliefs into a handbook makes them tangible and, most importantly, editable.
Making the company our best product is a guiding principle, but we can’t easily improve what we haven’t articulated. 
o whatever version of this handbook you’re reading, you can be sure it’s not the last. 
Please do help keep it up to date! And by up to date, we're not just talking about misspellings and team changes. 
It’s just as much “we say we’re about X, but what we’re really doing is Y”. 
So many of these employee handbook projects turn out to be ideal-case prescriptions rather than real-world descriptions. 
They cover all the ways people should act, not the ways they actually do. 
That’s a sham. Let’s not write a handbook like that. Let’s keep it honest.

If you’re reading this just after joining the company, it’s particularly on you, actually. 
It’s harder for us slowly-boiled frogs who’ve been with Teal Partners for a while to spot the broken ways. 
Please take advantage of that glorious, shiny ignorance of being new, and question things.
